# browser-editor

Purely in-browser text editor, built together with [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

Can be packed into 1 single html file and run on a browser for air-gapped environments without easy access to a text editor and doesn't play nice with .js files.
